# Description
This project is part of the [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project). Core features of Facebook including users, profiles, "friending", posts, news feed and "liking" is included. The user could also sign-in with their real Facebook account.

## Current status
Due to the lack of experience, knowledge and intelligence of the guy who write the project, although the project fulfill every requirements as stated in The Odin Project (exclude the deployment and actual email provider, as well as some extra credit), the guy decided to not deploy the site, as the application looks ugly. This guy has tasted the importance of tests, as he is now terrified in modify anything inside the application without knowing if anything has broken. As such, he had decided to move on for now, and came back after he gain more experience.
