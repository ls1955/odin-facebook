Clean Up

* Remove requests table status column ??

Implementation

* Only show remove post button for post owner
* Delete friend_request after being accepted ??
* At strangers#index, only show user who do not
  have any association(not friend, no friend request
  between user).

Refactor / Improvement

* User#stranger ??
  -> Test if return desired result
* FriendRequest::pending
  -> Sounds weird. Might rename or move it to other place

Idea

* After accepted friend_request
  -> Destroy friend_request
  -> Create a new friendship
  -> Redirect to page
