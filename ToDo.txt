Implementation

* Only show remove post button for post owner
* At strangers#index, only show user who do not
  have any association(not friend, no friend request
  between user).
* Include other omniauth providers such as google and github

Refactor / Improvement

* User#stranger ??
  - Test if return desired result
* FriendRequest::pending sounds weird. Might rename or move it to other place
* FriendRequestsController#accept involve creation of friendship.
  Consider creating FriendshipsController.
* Consider creating Like model, which link a user with post.
  user_id and post_id will be composite primary key.
  Purporse of this model is to ensure user could only like a post once.
* Post::relevent scope, is it appropriate?
* Create partial like posts/_comment, posts/_comment_collection,
  posts/_post_collection, etc...

Optimization

* Usage of turbo-frame, stimulus
* Keep track of possible N + 1 problems
* Allow user to like the posts without doing a full page reload

Bug

* Calling User#comments will select all the comments from the posts
  created by user, instead of selecting all the comments created by user.

View

* Move profile up to top header bar ??

CSS

* login page
* signup page
* posts#create
* friend_requests#index

Main task

* Deploy the app
* Set up email provider

Extra Credit

* Make post allow image (either via URL or an actual image file)
* Make post to be either text OR photo via polymorphic association
