Clean Up

* Remove requests table status column ??

Implementation

* Only show remove post button for post owner
* At strangers#index, only show user who do not
  have any association(not friend, no friend request
  between user).

Refactor / Improvement

* User#stranger ??
  -> Test if return desired result
* FriendRequest::pending sounds weird. Might rename or move it to other place
* FriendRequestsController#accept involve creation of friendship.
  Consider creating FriendshipsController.
* Consider creating Like model, which link a user with post.
  user_id and post_id will be composite primary key.
  Purporse of this model is to ensure user could only like a post once.

Optimization

* Usage of turbo-frame, stimulus
* Keep track of possible N + 1 problems
